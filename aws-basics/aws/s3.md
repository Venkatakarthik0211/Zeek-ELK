# what is s3 bucket policy

### S3 Bucket
An S3 bucket is a cloud storage resource in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that stores data and objects. Each bucket is identified by a unique key and can store an unlimited number of objects.

### S3 Bucket Policies
S3 bucket policies are JSON-based access policy documents that define what actions are allowed or denied for which principals on the bucket and the objects within it.

### Difference Between S3 Bucket Policies and Identity Policies
- **S3 Bucket Policies:** Attached directly to an S3 bucket, specifying permissions for bucket and object actions.
- **Identity Policies:** Attached to IAM users, groups, or roles, specifying what AWS resources these identities can access and what actions they can perform.

### Why S3 is Private by Default
S3 buckets are private by default to ensure the security and privacy of data. Only the bucket owner has access until explicit permissions are granted to others.

### How S3 Bucket Policies Allow Access from Same or Different Account
S3 bucket policies can include cross-account permissions, allowing access to users from different AWS accounts by specifying the AWS account ID or IAM roles from the other account.

### How S3 Bucket Policies Allow/Deny Anonymous Principals
S3 bucket policies can allow or deny access to anonymous principals (public access) by including or excluding the `"Principal": "*"` element in the policy document.

| Operation       | Description                                                      | Applies To       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `READ`          | Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket                 | Bucket/Object           |
| `WRITE`         | Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete objects in the bucket | Bucket           |
| `READ_ACP`      | Allows grantee to read the ACL of the bucket or object           | Bucket/Object    |
| `WRITE_ACP`     | Allows grantee to write the ACL for the bucket or object         | Bucket/Object    |
| `FULL_CONTROL`  | Provides grantee with `READ`, `WRITE`, `READ_ACP`, and `WRITE_ACP` permissions | Bucket/Object    |

### S3 Static Hosting
Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting allows you to host a static website directly from an S3 bucket. This feature enables you to serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) without the need for a web server.

### Offloading
Offloading in the context of S3 static hosting refers to the practice of transferring the hosting of static website assets (such as images, videos, and other media) from a traditional web server to an S3 bucket. This reduces the load on your web server, increases scalability, and often lowers costs.

### Out of Band Pages
Out of Band Pages in S3 static hosting are custom error pages (like 404 or 500 error pages) that are served when a user tries to access a non-existent or forbidden resource on the static website. These pages provide a better user experience by delivering helpful information or redirects instead of generic error messages.

### S3 Storage Classes Comparison Table

| Storage Class                       | Use Cases                                                                 | First Byte Latency     |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**                     | General purpose storage for frequently accessed data                     | milliseconds           |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering***         | Automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns | milliseconds           |
| **S3 Express One Zone**             | High performance storage for your most frequently accessed data          | single-digit milliseconds |
| **S3 Standard-IA**                  | Infrequently accessed data that needs millisecond access                 | milliseconds           |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**                  | Re-creatable infrequently accessed data                                  | milliseconds           |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**    | Long-lived data that is accessed a few times per year with instant retrievals | milliseconds       |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval***  | Backup and archive data that is rarely accessed and low cost             | minutes or hours       |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive***        | Archive data that is very rarely accessed and very low cost              | hours                  |

\* **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: Charges additional monitoring and automation fees.
\** **S3 One Zone-IA**: Stores data in a single availability zone, which is less resilient than multi-zone storage.
\*** **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** and **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: Retrieval times can vary based on the retrieval option chosen.

### Object Versioning in S3
Object versioning in Amazon S3 is a feature that keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, allowing you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your S3 bucket.

### Enabling and Disabling Object Versioning
Once object versioning is enabled on an S3 bucket, it cannot be disabled, only suspended. Suspending versioning stops the creation of new versions but retains existing versions.
