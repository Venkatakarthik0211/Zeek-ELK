# AWS Lambda Explained

AWS Lambda is a **serverless** compute service provided by AWS. It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, paying only for the compute time consumed. It is a **Function as a Service(FaaS)**. Hereâ€™s an overview of AWS Lambda: 

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda lets you execute code in response to events such as changes to data in Amazon S3 buckets, updates to Amazon DynamoDB tables, or HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway. It automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger, ensuring high availability and scalability.

`Note:` Docker is not same as aws lambda, lambda uses docker images of runtime, but it is not docker and not even related to AWS ECS.

# Types of lambda

Public Lambda: A public lambda function is accessible and can be invoked by any external entity or service.

Private Lambda: A private lambda function is restricted and can only be invoked within the same AWS account or within a specified VPC.

- In new private lambda functions, every lambda function is connected to a single network interface, avoiding to spawn different network interfaces for different lambda functions

# Types of lambda function based on Invocation

There are three types of invocations for AWS Lambda functions:

1. Synchronous Invocation: In this type of invocation, the calling application waits for a response from the Lambda function before proceeding. The response can be a success or an error message. (Human interaction with web application)

2. Asynchronous Invocation: In this type of invocation, the calling application does not wait for a response from the Lambda function. The function is invoked and the calling application continues its execution without waiting for the function to complete.

3. Event Source Mappings: Event Source Mappings in AWS Lambda allow you to connect event sources, such as Amazon Kinesis streams, to your Lambda functions. This enables your functions to automatically trigger in form of **event batches** and process events from these sources. 

`note:` Lambda doesn't directly read data from these sources, lambda function should be attached with a **execution role** with kinesis permissions to read data from the kinesis in form of **event batches**

## Key Features

### Serverless Execution

Lambda runs your code on a highly available and fault-tolerant infrastructure managed by AWS. You don't need to provision or manage servers, ensuring cost efficiency and scalability.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Lambda is designed to respond to events generated by other AWS services or custom events. For example, it can process file uploads to S3, perform data transformations in response to DynamoDB updates, or handle API requests via API Gateway.

### Pay-Per-Use Billing

You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time your code executes. There are no charges when your code is not running.

### Supported Runtimes and Languages

Lambda supports a variety of programming languages including Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, and .NET Core. You can also bring your own runtime using custom runtimes.

### Integrations with AWS Services

Lambda integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, SNS, SQS, and more, enabling serverless workflows and microservices architectures.

## Limitations
- Indirectly memory of vCPUs for Lambda can be controlled based on memory, we can scale from 512MB(default) to 10240MB
- Based on 1MB steps, 1 vCPU = 1769MB

## Use Cases

### Real-Time File Processing

Lambda can process files uploaded to S3, trigger data transformations, and store results back in S3 or DynamoDB.

### Backend for Mobile and Web Applications

Serve backend functionalities such as user authentication, database operations, and API integrations without managing servers.

### IoT Data Processing

Handle incoming data streams from IoT devices, perform real-time analytics, and trigger actions based on sensor data.

## Getting Started

To create a Lambda function, you define your code in AWS Lambda console, CLI, or SDK. You specify the event source (trigger), configure runtime settings, and set up permissions using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with the size of your workload.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the compute time you consume.
- **Operational Simplicity**: No need to manage servers or infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with other AWS services for building complex architectures.

## Conclusion

AWS Lambda simplifies application development by allowing you to focus on writing code and responding to events, without the complexity of managing servers. It is ideal for building scalable, event-driven applications and microservices in a cost-effective manner.
