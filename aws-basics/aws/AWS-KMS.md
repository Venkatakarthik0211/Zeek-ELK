# AWS KMS Architecture and Functionality

## 1. AWS KMS Architecture

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy to create and control cryptographic keys used to encrypt data. The architecture of AWS KMS involves several components and processes:

### Key Components

- **Customer Master Keys (CMKs)**: These are the primary resources in KMS. CMKs can be either symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric CMKs use a single key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric CMKs use a public-private key pair.
- **Data Keys**: These are keys generated by KMS and used to encrypt data. They are encrypted using a CMK and can be used outside of KMS.
- **KMS API**: AWS provides a set of APIs to interact with KMS for various operations like key creation, encryption, decryption, and key management.
- **KMS Service**: The underlying infrastructure that manages the creation, rotation, and usage of keys. This includes hardware security modules (HSMs) which provide physical security for key storage.

### Key Processes

- **Key Creation**: When you create a CMK, it is generated within a KMS-managed HSM and is never exposed in plaintext outside the HSM.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Data is encrypted using data keys, which are in turn encrypted by CMKs. KMS handles the generation and management of these data keys.
- **Key Management**: KMS allows for the management of key policies, rotation of CMKs, and auditing of key usage through AWS CloudTrail.

## 2. Encrypted Data Storage in KMS

In AWS KMS, data keys and other cryptographic material are always encrypted and stored securely within KMS. When you use KMS to encrypt data:

- The data is encrypted with a data key.
- The data key is then encrypted with a CMK.
- The encrypted data key and the encrypted data are stored together, but the plaintext data key is never exposed outside KMS.

## 3. Key Storage Size Limitation

AWS KMS has a size limitation for the keys it stores. Specifically:

- KMS will store keys up to 4KB in size.
- This size limitation is primarily for CMKs and other cryptographic material managed by KMS.

## 4. FIPS 140-2 Level 2 and its Relation to KMS

### FIPS 140-2 Level 2 Overview

FIPS 140-2 is a U.S. government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules. The standard has different levels, with Level 2 providing a moderate level of security. Key features of FIPS 140-2 Level 2 include:

- **Tamper-Evidence**: Cryptographic modules must show evidence of tampering.
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Users must be authenticated before accessing the cryptographic module.
- **Enhanced Security**: The standard includes additional requirements for physical security and operating system security.

### Relation to AWS KMS

AWS KMS uses HSMs that are validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 2. This means:

- The HSMs used by KMS meet the security requirements set by FIPS 140-2 Level 2.
- Data keys and CMKs are stored within these validated HSMs, ensuring a high level of security.
- Organizations requiring compliance with FIPS 140-2 Level 2 can rely on AWS KMS for their cryptographic needs.

# Key Concepts

- **KMS Keys are isolated to a region & never leave**:
  - Each KMS key is created and used within a specific AWS region. These keys do not leave their region of origin, ensuring data sovereignty and compliance with regional regulations.

- **AWS Owned & Customer Owned**:
  - KMS keys can be owned by AWS or the customer. AWS-owned keys are managed entirely by AWS, while customer-owned keys provide more control and customization options.

- **With Customer ownedâ€¦ AWS Managed or Customer Managed KEYS**:
  - Customer-owned keys can be either AWS managed or customer managed:
    - **AWS Managed**: AWS handles the management tasks such as key rotation and deletion.
    - **Customer Managed**: Customers are responsible for managing the keys, giving them more control over key policies and permissions.

- **Customer managed keys are more configurable**:
  - Customer managed keys offer greater flexibility in terms of configuration, including setting key policies, enabling key rotation, and defining usage permissions.

- **KMS Keys support rotation**:
  - AWS KMS supports automatic key rotation for symmetric CMKs, helping enhance security by regularly rotating the cryptographic material.

- **Backing Key (and previous backing keys)**:
  - A backing key is the cryptographic material used by a CMK. When a key is rotated, new backing keys are generated, but previous backing keys are retained to decrypt data encrypted with older keys.

- **Aliases**:
  - Aliases are user-friendly names that can be associated with CMKs. They provide an easy way to reference keys without using their complex key IDs.
