      <h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Amazon EC2 is a computing service that runs virtual servers in the cloud.</li>
        <li>It allows you to launch Linux or Windows virtual machines to host your application and manage them remotely from anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>Amazon EC2 is categorized as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and acts as a basic building block for cloud infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Amazon EC2 is a building block for AWS, used by some AWS services for processing, database hosting, and serverless computing.</li>
        <li>AWS and users share responsibility in managing EC2 virtual machines:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>AWS manages data centers, physical facilities, hardware components, the host operating system, and the virtualization layer.</li>
            <li>Users are responsible for the guest operating system, applying OS patches, setting up security access controls, and managing data.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>EC2's elasticity allows it to be changed, resized, or customized at any point in time.</li>
        <li>EC2 can automatically scale, increasing or decreasing the number of instances based on incoming traffic.</li>
        <li>The term "C2" in Amazon EC2 refers to the two C's of "Compute Cloud."</li>
        <li>Amazon EC2 integrates with various AWS services and features.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>AWS Lambda</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code, functions, or entire applications without managing servers.</li>
        <li>You only pay for the compute time that you actually consume.</li>
        <li>Although serverless computing uses servers, all server management, scaling, and troubleshooting are handled by AWS.</li>
        <li>Uploaded code in AWS Lambda is called a Lambda function.</li>
        <li>Lambda functions can perform custom tasks that you control or program.</li>
        <li>Lambda functions are highly scalable, supporting thousands of requests in seconds.</li>
        <li>AWS Lambda provides high availability without additional effort on your part.</li>
        <li>It is a fully managed service, meaning AWS manages the underlying servers, and you cannot access or manage these servers.</li>
        <li>AWS Lambda supports multiple programming languages including Java, Go, Ruby, Node.js, Python, and others through the use of runtimes.</li>
        <li>These runtimes are powered by Amazon Linux EC2 and other servers, which are managed by AWS.</li>

            <li>You can upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk handles:
                <ul>
                    <li>Capacity provisioning</li>

                    <li>Access these servers at any time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <li>With AWS Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software or server clusters.</li>
        <li>The service handles planning, scheduling, and execution of batch computing workloads using Amazon EC2 instances.</li>
        <li>This allows users to focus on analyzing results and solving problems rather than managing infrastructure.</li>

            <li>The outpost rack is two feet wide and four feet deep.</li>
            <li>The server rack contains hosts, switches, another patch panel, and other components, similar to what AWS uses for its public Amazon EC2 servers that power your applications in the cloud.</li>
            <li>AWS delivers the outpost rack to your preferred physical site fully assembled.</li>
            <li>You just need to plug it in, configure it, and you're ready to go.</li>
