## AWS Services for Blue/Green Deployments

- **Amazon Route 53**: A scalable DNS service that allows administrators to route traffic by updating DNS records, supporting blue/green deployments with health checks and TTL adjustments.

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances and integrates with Auto Scaling, making it ideal for directing traffic during blue/green deployments. (**Keeping the Instances in Standby is better option than removing instances which will make utilize the blue instances if something goes wrong**)

- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts EC2 capacity based on conditions and supports blue/green deployments by allowing different launch configurations and quick rollbacks with standby state.

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Simplifies deployment and management of applications, enabling blue/green deployments through environment URL swapping and integrated support for Auto Scaling and ELB.

- **AWS OpsWorks**: A configuration management service(**Based On Chef**) that facilitates blue/green deployments by cloning entire stacks and managing application configurations.

- **AWS CloudFormation**: Automates the provisioning and updating of blue/green environments using code, supporting Route 53 DNS, ELB, and other traffic switching tools.

- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors AWS resources and application health, providing early detection and system-wide visibility critical for managing blue/green deployments.

- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automates deployments with support for blue/green strategies, including rollback on failure and integration with CloudWatch for monitoring deployment health or services such as Lambda functions, On-Prem Instances, EC2, ECS

- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: Offers traffic shifting options during deployments, such as Canary, Linear, and All-at-once, facilitating controlled blue/green deployments.

- **AWS Lambda Hooks**: Enables custom workflows during blue/green deployments by invoking Lambda functions(**Using The Integration with CodeDeploy**) at various lifecycle events, enhancing deployment flexibility and control.
